# Customer Churn Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict customer churn using a dataset provided by the user. The application is built using **Streamlit** and **scikit-learn** to train and evaluate a **RandomForestClassifier** on the provided data.

## Features

- Upload a CSV file containing customer data.
- The CSV file must contain a column named `Churn`, which represents whether a customer has churned or not.
- The model will predict churn and provide an accuracy score based on the uploaded data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `streamlit`
